# 📈 Stock Market Analysis – Price Prediction Using LSTM, SVM & Random Forest

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting stock prices using three different models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest regression. The goal is to compare the performance of these models on historical stock market data and evaluate their effectiveness in forecasting future prices.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- `LSTM SVM RF.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook implementing:
  - Data preprocessing and visualization
  - LSTM model for time series prediction
  - SVM and Random Forest regression models
  - Model evaluation and comparison

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** A type of recurrent neural network suitable for time series forecasting, capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine):** A supervised learning model used for regression tasks, effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Random Forest Regression:** An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees and outputting the mean prediction.

## 📊 Dataset

The models are trained and tested on historical stock price data. The dataset includes features such as:

- Open, High, Low, Close prices
- Volume
- Date and Time indicators
